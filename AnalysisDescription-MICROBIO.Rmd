Methods:
1. Sample sizes >40, median + percentiles
2. Sample sizes <40, outliers
3. Compare values to ISIS
4. Full table with all values with N, quantiles, min-max, SD, SE
5. Prevalences --> % positives on the population
6. Jaccard similarity coefficient for bacterias for cavities. Sj=1, same bio profile, Sj=0, different
     [Sj = j/(a+b-j)], j = number of species of bacteria that occurred in both the tapir populations in the AF and PA study sites; a = number of species of bacteria that occurred in the PA population; b = number of species of bacteria that occurred in the AF population. AF and PA --> Sj=0.125
7. x2 (chi-square) test for prevalence in different bacterias in study sites --> Not significant for the bacts found in both PT and MA

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
