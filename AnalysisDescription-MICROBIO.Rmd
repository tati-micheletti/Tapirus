Methods from Medici et al., 2014:
For the analyses of hematologic and biochemical 
parameters with sample sizes >40,
the median was used as a measure of central
tendency, and the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles
were used to specify the 95% reference
interval (CSLI 2008). The central 95% provided
an estimate of the normal range (Rhoads
2007). For parameters with <40 samples,
outlier cuts were applied and determined by
the one-third rule, derived from a test
originally proposed by Dixon (1953) and
recommended by CLSI (2008). Recapture
data were used only when recapture events
took place at intervals longer than 30 days.

Hematologic and biochemical variables were
tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and
variance homogeneity (Levene’s test), and
compared by groups (study site.sex.age class)
using parametric analysis of variance, when
data were normal and homogeneous before or
after transformation (loge). The nonparametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was used when data were
not normal, even after transformation; alpha
was set to 0.05. Statistical differences between
the anesthetic protocols could not be evaluated
due to the unbalanced samples. Hematologic
and biochemical results were also tested against
tapir reference values from ISIS (Teare 2006),
‘‘all ages all classes’’ category, through a single
sample t-test.

Values for hematology and biochemical
parameters were expressed in SI units and
the following data were presented for each
parameter evaluated: valid sample size (N),
mean, range (minimum and maximum values),
lower quartile (Q1), median, upper quartile
(Q3), SD, and SE. Physical examination,
physiologic, and urinary parameters were
tabulated and presented descriptively.
The bacterial relative prevalence in anatomic
cavities and lesions was analyzed for each
study site and each cavity. The diversity of
bacteria in each study site and the similarity
between sites were measured by the Jaccard
similarity coefficient (Sj; Magurran 1988,
2004), where Sj51 would mean that both
study sites had the same microbiologic profile,
and Sj50 would mean that they had completely
different microbiologic profiles (Wilson
and Mohler 1983). Prevalence of bacterial
strains present in both study sites was
compared through a x2 (chi-square) test.
To evaluate the prevalence of serologic
responses to infectious agents, the tapir population
in the AF was estimated to be 130
individuals (Medici 2010). The study in the PA
is ongoing, and population size estimates for the
study site are preliminary (60–100 individuals;
E.P.M. unpubl. data). The sampling prevalence
was calculated as the proportion of tapirs with
positive antibody responses in each study site
(annually and for the entire study period). The

95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
as a ‘‘simple random sampling,’’ according to
sample size (small, medium, or large) and
proportion of estimated population size (Thrusfield
2007). When prevalence was,5%, CI was
calculated according to Wilson (1927), as
recommended by Thrusfield (2007). When
prevalence was 0 or 100%, the Clopper and
Pearson (1934) methodology was applied. Chisquare
tests were used to compare prevalence
data by study site.


RESULTS:
In the AF, 10 bacterial species were
identified in anatomic cavities. Staphylococcus
aureus and Escherichia coli were
found in all anatomic cavities. In the PA,
26 bacteria were identified; S. aureus was
the most prevalent species in anatomic
cavities and present in 100% of sampled
dermal lesions. Other bacteria found in at
least five different cavities were Acinetobacter
sp., Gram-positive bacilli, E. coli,
Klebsiella pneunomae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and coagulase-negative staphylococci
(Supplementary Material Table S4).
The calculation of similarity of bacteria
species found in the AF and PA resulted
in Sj50.125, which means a low similarity
between sites. Nevertheless, when comparing
the prevalence of the four taxa
found in both the AF and PA (Enterobacter
sp., E. coli, Staphylococcus sp., and S.
aureus) there were no significant differences
between the two tapir populations.

Infectious agents
The analyses of infectious agents allowed
for important comparisons between
the AF and PA tapir populations, as well as
between sampling periods within each
study site (annual disease prevalence;
Supplementary Material Tables S5 and
S6).
Antibodies were detected for six agents:
Bluetongue virus, eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE) virus, western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus, infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus, porcine
parvovirus, and Leptospira interrogans (10
serovars: Autumnalis, Bratislava, Canicola,
Copenhageni, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo,
Hebdomadis, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona,
and Pyrogenes).
The serologic screening for infectious
agents revealed a high prevalence of
exposure to L. interrogans in both sites,
with 25% prevalence in the AF (95% CI:
12–38%) and 75% in the PA (95% CI:
66.1–83.9 for minimum estimated population
size, and 63.7–86.3% for maximum
estimated population size). Three L.
interrogans serovars were found in the
AF (Autumnalis, Hebdomadis, and Pomona),
and eight in the PA (Bratislava,
Canicola, Copenhageni, Grippotyphosa,
Hardjo, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona,
and Pyrogenes). Pomona was the only
serovar found in both populations. Eleven
samples in the PA had antibody to three
serovars. In the AF, antibody titers for L.
interrogans Pomona were between 100
and 800, Autumnalis 400, and Hebdomadis
200. In the PA, considerably higher
antibody titers were found: Pomona 100–
3200, Bratislava 100–800, Icterohaemorrhagiae
100–800, Copenhageni 100–400,
Canicola 100, Grippotyphosa 100, and
Pyrogenes 800. Despite the high antibody
titers, there were no clinical signs or
laboratory results indicating disease.
The serologic response to bluetongue
virus antigen resulted in a prevalence of
15.6% (95% CI: 4.7–26.5%) in the AF and
2.8% (95% CI: 0.3–12.6%) in the PA.
Antibody to IBR virus was observed in
3.1% (95% CI: 0.06–15.7%) of the AF and
2.8% (95% CI: 0.3–12.3%) of the PA.
Antibodies to EEE and WEE viruses were
found only in the AF population: 18.7%
(95% CI: 7–30.4%) and 3.1% (95% CI:
0.06–15.7%), respectively. Porcine parvovirus
antibody was found only in the PA in
100% of evaluated tapirs (95% CI: 90.3–
100%).
Significant differences in antibody
prevalence between the study sites were
found for L. interrogans (P50.000), EEE
virus (P50.006), and porcine parvovirus
(P,0.000). Nevertheless, there was no
pattern in the distribution of positive
results throughout the sampling period
for most of the pathogens, except for L.
interrogans and porcine parvovirus in the
PA population.
