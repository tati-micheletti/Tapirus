Infectious agents
The analyses of infectious agents allowed
for important comparisons between
the AF and PA tapir populations, as well as
between sampling periods within each
study site (annual disease prevalence;
Supplementary Material Tables S5 and
S6).
Antibodies were detected for six agents:
Bluetongue virus, eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE) virus, western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus, infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus, porcine
parvovirus, and Leptospira interrogans (10
serovars: Autumnalis, Bratislava, Canicola,
Copenhageni, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo,
Hebdomadis, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona,
and Pyrogenes).
The serologic screening for infectious
agents revealed a high prevalence of
exposure to L. interrogans in both sites,
with 25% prevalence in the AF (95% CI:
12–38%) and 75% in the PA (95% CI:
66.1–83.9 for minimum estimated population
size, and 63.7–86.3% for maximum
estimated population size). Three L.
interrogans serovars were found in the
AF (Autumnalis, Hebdomadis, and Pomona),
and eight in the PA (Bratislava,
Canicola, Copenhageni, Grippotyphosa,
Hardjo, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona,
and Pyrogenes). Pomona was the only
serovar found in both populations. Eleven
samples in the PA had antibody to three
serovars. In the AF, antibody titers for L.
interrogans Pomona were between 100
and 800, Autumnalis 400, and Hebdomadis
200. In the PA, considerably higher
antibody titers were found: Pomona 100–
3200, Bratislava 100–800, Icterohaemorrhagiae
100–800, Copenhageni 100–400,
Canicola 100, Grippotyphosa 100, and
Pyrogenes 800. Despite the high antibody
titers, there were no clinical signs or
laboratory results indicating disease.
The serologic response to bluetongue
virus antigen resulted in a prevalence of
15.6% (95% CI: 4.7–26.5%) in the AF and
2.8% (95% CI: 0.3–12.6%) in the PA.
Antibody to IBR virus was observed in
3.1% (95% CI: 0.06–15.7%) of the AF and
2.8% (95% CI: 0.3–12.3%) of the PA.
Antibodies to EEE and WEE viruses were
found only in the AF population: 18.7%
(95% CI: 7–30.4%) and 3.1% (95% CI:
0.06–15.7%), respectively. Porcine parvovirus
antibody was found only in the PA in
100% of evaluated tapirs (95% CI: 90.3–
100%).
Significant differences in antibody
prevalence between the study sites were
found for L. interrogans (P50.000), EEE
virus (P50.006), and porcine parvovirus
(P,0.000). Nevertheless, there was no
pattern in the distribution of positive
results throughout the sampling period
for most of the pathogens, except for L.
interrogans and porcine parvovirus in the
PA population.
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
